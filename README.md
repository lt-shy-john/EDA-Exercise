# John Yeung's EDA Exercise

In summer 2020-2021 I have attempted 2 EDA exercise on a broad range of topics: Pokemon Pokedex and random stock prices. This repository is a catalogue of my findings.

## Catalogue
* Pokedex
* Stock (Yes, GameStop is one of the stocks analysed. )
* Kaggle survey results (To-do, dataset will not be published here)
* US Census Data (Not part of original plan, to-do)
